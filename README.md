## Problem Statement — PS43

PS43 focuses on connecting **citizens, government, universities and industry** to identify societal problems and turn them into practical solutions.

The challenge is not just reporting a problem, but creating a clear path from the **problem to the people who can solve it**.

## Our Solution

JAN SETU provides this workflow in one platform.

**Report → Match → Solve → Track**

Citizens can report problems with details, location and supporting images. The system processes the problem, identifies relevant expertise and connects it with potential solvers and industry experts.

## Duplicate Handling
